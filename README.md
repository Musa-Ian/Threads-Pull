## iPhone Shortcuts Integration

ThreadsPull is designed to work seamlessly with iOS Shortcuts. Here's how to create a simple shortcut for downloading media from Threads:

1. Create a new Shortcut in the Shortcuts app
2. Add a "URL" action with your deployed ThreadsPull API endpoint
3. Add a "Get Contents of URL" action with the following settings:
   - Method: POST
   - Request Body: JSON
   - URL: The URL from the first action
   - JSON Body: `{"url": "Shortcut Input"}`
4. Add a "Get Dictionary Value" action to extract the media URLs
5. Add a "Download File" or "Quick Look" action to save or preview the media

### Example Shortcut Steps:

1. Accept Threads URL as input
2. Send URL to ThreadsPull API
3. Parse JSON response
4. For each media URL:
   - Download the file
   - Save to Photos or Files
